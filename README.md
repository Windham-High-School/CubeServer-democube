# CubeServer-democube
Demo software to demonstrate core networking-related features as a means of testing CubeServer and reliability thereof

## This is not a way to cheat!
This could be a great place to start in terms of examples, but a cube running the software in this repository would perform horribly.

This software is optimized for effective and efficient testing of the core functions of the server, while paying no heed to important considerations like power management and the signal light, etc.

Again, feel free to have a look or steal some snippets from here, but I can promise you that you won't last long in the competition if plagiarizing just this repository!
